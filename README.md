# Bank_ Churn_Analysis_project
This project is focused on analyzing bank customer churn â€” that is, how many customers left the bank. It uses sample data to practice cleaning, modeling, and visualizing information in Power BI.

The process includes:

Connecting to and preparing the data

Cleaning columns (like renaming and changing values)

Creating new conditional columns (like Age Group, Credit Score range, etc.)

Creating reference tables for Age Group, Account Balance, and Credit Score

Making DAX measures for total customers, lost customers, and churn rate

Creating visuals like cards, donut charts, line charts, and stacked column charts to show insights such as churn rate by age, gender, credit card status, and more
